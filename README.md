# The visualization of solving the metric Traveling Salesman Problem

Application focuses on the visualization of solving the metric Traveling Salesman
Problem using exact and metaheuristic methods. The research aims to compare and understand
the differences between these two classes of algorithms. In the theoretical part of the thesis, the
Traveling Salesman Problem is discussed. Exact methods, such as the Brute Force algorithm,
are presented, which guarantee finding the optimal solution but have a high computational
cost for larger problem instances. Then, the focus is shifted to metaheuristics, such as genetic
algorithms and tabu search, which are computationally more efficient but do not guarantee
an optimal solution. In the practical part of the thesis, these methods are implemented and
tested on various instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem. Subsequently, the results of
both classes of algorithms are compared in terms of solution quality and computational time
complexity.

Exact methods:
- Brute force,
- Held-Karp,
- Depth-First search,
- Breadth-First search.

Metaheuristic methods:
- Nearest neighbor,
- Genetic,
- Ant,
- Tabu search,
- Simulated annealing.

The traveling salesman problem (TSP) involves solving the
the difficult computational problem of finding the shortest route that
visits all given cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. This
optimization problem is well known in the field of theoretical computer science and operations research.
operations. It is classified as an NP-hard problem, meaning that there is no known
algorithm that solves it in a reasonable amount of time for large instances.
